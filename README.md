PROJECT TITLE: SENSE

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: To answer the question of beauty accessibility, we've chosen to target the An Our code is nothing but 2 webpages that are built using HTML, CSS & JS. What's new is our VR Garden, this uses a lightweight web framework called A-Frame that helps us build 3D & VR experiences on the web. A few reasons as to why we chose A-Frame over an established graphical engine like Unity or Unreal Engine are as follows;

  1) It's based upon HTML which makes it compatible with any generic website, which means that it doesn't really matter what tools your vendor has used to build your respective brand's website (may it be Joe Malone, Tom Ford or even Le Labo), we can still intergrate this VR experience amongst all of them with no issues at all.
  
  2) It's lightweight which reduces one's hosting costs and is easily accessible by a wide variety of devices since A-Frame scenes don't require an absurd amount of graphical power to work.
  
  3) A-Frame is not just a 3D scene graph or a markup language; the core is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to Three.JS. Three.JS is maintainted by developers from Supermedium & Google which assures that there will be a great deal of support as well as further increments to both Three.JS & A-Frame in the future.
  
HOW TO RUN: For starters, you'd want to clone our Github Repo onto your local machine. Once that's done, you can use a liveserver plugin within your IDE to locally host our static website along with all it's respective dependencies. 

Note: You don't need any external installations to run A-Frame as we're remotely importing the JS library directly into our html file.

HOW TO USE: So our solution currently works the best with full fledged desktop browsers, though we feel that it can be made compatible with mobile devices provided more time and resources. 

Since this is only a POC and the main highlight is really the highlight, we didn't really replicate JM's webpage to work with different screen aspect ratio's or screen sizes, hence we recommend that your system maintains the same display standards as shown in the image below.

Once your display settings are configured, Please maximize your browser window and WE CAN BEGIN! Here is the ideal user journey we've mapped out for our customers;
