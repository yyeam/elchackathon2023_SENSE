PROJECT TITLE: SÉNSE

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: To increase beauty accessibility, our solution SÉNSE allows for the anosmic community (and online shoppers) to take a journey and experience the joy of purchasing fragrances online. ELC’s fragrances are more than just a scent, it is a story waiting to be discovered. SENSE is a fully immersive sensory VR experience that uses a combination of visual and auditory cues that transports the user to a place where fragrance becomes a part of them, a memory that will linger long after the experience is over.   

HOW TO RUN: For starters, clone the Github Repo onto your local machine. Once that's done, you can use a liveserver plugin within your IDE to locally host our static website along with all it's respective dependencies.
